Sample IBM i application (SAMCO) with multiple source types using project metadata defined in iproj.json.

I recently worked with **#IBMBob** for refactoring existing green screen applications and here's a first feedback. Please REFER to Branch [tobitest](https://github.com/bmarolleau/bob-ibmi-demo/tree/tobitest) to see the result of the refactoring. My experience: User experience using Bob preview version was excellent ! In a few hours and guided interactions, Bob & I managed to create a first version of the application with brand new docs, new front-end app, and refactored back-end programs.

Initial prompt : 
*Hello Bob, in this folder, a legacy application with various "IBM i" languages like RPG , CL, COBOL... I would like to modernize one screen/menu on Articles, could you generate architecture schemas and docs,  equivalent 'screens' in react (IBM Carbon Design System) with web service client to back-end. I'll create REST services from each service program."*

Application build is performed with [Tobi](https://ibm.github.io/ibmi-tobi/#/) with the appropriate makei command. IBM Bob will do the rest. 

Documentation generated by Bob was stored here in the [moderzation-plan](./modernization-plan/) directory.

Front-end application is generated in the [article-management-web](./article-management-web) directory.

**Please use this repository to see and test for yourself!!**
